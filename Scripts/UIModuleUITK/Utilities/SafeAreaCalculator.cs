    /// <para><b>Why this is a separate static class.</b> It is the only part of the safe
    /// area that can be wrong in a way a test can catch. Everything else —
    /// registering for geometry changes, assigning four style properties — is plumbing.
    /// Pulling the maths out means the edge cases (no inset, a degenerate safe area, a
    /// landscape panel, a safe area reported larger than the screen) are exercised
    /// without a panel, a screen or a device in sight.</para>
    ///
    /// <para><b>Why <c>pixelsPerPoint</c> and not a panel size.</b>
    /// <c>Screen.safeArea</c> is in real screen pixels; a <c>VisualElement</c>'s
    /// <c>style.paddingLeft</c> is in panel units. <see cref="IPanel.scaledPixelsPerPoint"/>
    /// is exactly the ratio between them — it already folds in
    /// <see cref="PanelSettings.scaleMode"/>, the reference resolution and the match
    /// value — so dividing by it is the whole conversion. Deriving the same factor from
    /// a panel rect divided by the screen rect would work only while the panel covers
    /// the full screen, which stops being true the moment anyone sets a
    /// <c>targetTexture</c>.</para>
    ///
    /// <para><b>The Y axis flips.</b> <c>Screen.safeArea</c> has its origin at the bottom
    /// left, UI Toolkit lays out from the top left. So the TOP inset is measured from
    /// <c>safeArea.yMax</c> up to the screen height, and the BOTTOM inset is
    /// <c>safeArea.yMin</c> itself — not the other way round, which is the single easiest
    /// thing to get backwards here and puts the notch cut-out along the home bar.</para>
